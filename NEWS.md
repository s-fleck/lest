# lest 1.1.0

  * Added `exceeds_tumbling_sum()` for checking when a partial cumulative sum
  ("tumbling sum"") hits a certain threshold value. This is for example useful
  for filtering geographic positions by a minimum distance. Thanks to
  [@klmr](https://github.com/klmr) for helping me come up with a name.
    
  * Added plain C clones of `dplyr::cumall()` and `dplyr::cumany()`




# lest 1.0.0

* First public release
