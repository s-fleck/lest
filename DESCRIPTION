Description: Functions for vectorised conditional recoding
    of variables. case_when() enables you to vectorise multiple if and
    else statements (like 'CASE WHEN' in 'SQL'). if_else() is a stricter
    and more predictable version of ifelse() in 'base' that preserves
    attributes. These functions are forked from 'dplyr' with all package
    dependencies removed and behave identically to the originals.
